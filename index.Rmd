# This is Yiming's website  

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font size = "5" color = "blue"> I'm Yiming Zhao. Welcome to my website! I am a first year Biostatistic master student in TM track. I come from Beijing, China.  My hobbies are baking, traveling and reading. My favourite quote is : " Numen Lumen." Oh, I forgot to say, I have a British Shorthair cat. His name is cat. hahaha   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a freshman mailman student, I would be very happy to introduce myself from both my education experience and my life. Are you ready to take a close look at my life ?!</font>
